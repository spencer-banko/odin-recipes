    <h3><strong><u>INSTRUCTIONS</u></strong></h3>
    <ol>
        <li>Preheat the oven to 350 F</li>
        <li>Microwave the butter for about 40 seconds. Butter should be completely melted but shouldn't be hot.</li>
        <li>In a large bowl, mix butter with the sugars until well-combined.</li>
        <li>Stir in vanilla and egg until incorporated.</li>
        <li>Add the flour, baking soda, and salt. Please read the recipe note about properly measuring flour. </li>
        <li>Mix dough until just combined. Dough should be soft and a little sticky but not overly sticky.</li>
        <li>Stir in chocolate chips.</li>
        <li>Scoop out 1.5 tablespoons of dough (medium cookie scoop) and place 2 inches apart on baking sheet.
        </li>
        <li>Bake for 7-10 minutes, or until cookies are set. They will be puffy and still look a little underbaked in the middle.</li>
    </ol>
